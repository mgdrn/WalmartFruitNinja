# Fruit Ninja Clone

This is a small project I made for my comp sci final.

## How to build/requirements
### REQUIREMENTS:
  python3
  pip
  flask (pip install flask)
  sqlitedict (pip install sqlitedict)

### How to run
  Simply run the `server.py` file and then visit http://127.0.0.1:5000! 
  Functions like the leaderboard won't work as you'll need to update the endpoint in gamerunner.js
